## Stuff to Install

**Install #1: VS Code**  

VS Code is the IDE via which we program our robot  

Do NOT install it from their website, you need a FRC-specific one. Download it from here:  
https://github.com/wpilibsuite/allwpilib/releases  
Scroll down to `WPILibInstaller_Windows[32/64]... .zip`

**Install #2: Gitkraken**  

We organize our code using Git - it is important to make a GitHub account here: https://github.com/  
Ask Craig for permission to join Bit Buckets group so that you can make changes to the code  

Gitkraken is a means of visualizing uploading and changes progress, and is strongly recommended
